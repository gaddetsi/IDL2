### TASK 1 
# MLP and CNN Image Classification

## Description
This project implements and compares Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script directly:
```bash
python task1_mlp_cnn.py
```


## Output
The script provides:
- Model architecture summaries
- Training progress for each model
- Test accuracy results
- Performance comparison between MLP and CNN models
